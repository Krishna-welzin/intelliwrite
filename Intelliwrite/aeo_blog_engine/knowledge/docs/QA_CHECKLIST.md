# AEO/GEO Quality Assurance Checklist

Use this checklist to review every piece of content before finalizing.

## Structural Basics
- [ ] **One H1 Only:** Is there exactly one H1 tag containing the main topic?
- [ ] **Question-Based Headings:** Are H2s and H3s phrased as questions where appropriate?
- [ ] **Hierarchy:** Is the nesting logical (H1 > H2 > H3)? No skipping levels (e.g., H1 to H3).

## The "Answer-First" Test
- [ ] **Immediate Answer:** Does the first paragraph under a heading answer the question directly?
- [ ] **Word Count:** Is the direct answer between 20–50 words?
- [ ] **No Fluff:** Did you remove "In this section, we will discuss..." type preambles?

## Formatting & Readability
- [ ] **Short Paragraphs:** Are paragraphs kept to 2-3 sentences max?
- [ ] **Lists:** Are lists used for steps, items, or key points (instead of comma-separated text)?
- [ ] **Bold Key Terms:** Are important concepts bolded for skimmability?

## GEO/AI-Readiness
- [ ] **Context:** Is the answer supported by "Why" or "How" details immediately after?
- [ ] **Citations/Trust:** Are claims backed by mentions of credible sources or specific data points (if applicable)?
- [ ] **Natural Language:** Does it sound like a helpful human expert, not a keyword-stuffed robot?

## Schema & Technical (If implementing code)
- [ ] **Schema Type:** Is the content suitable for FAQPage or Article schema?
- [ ] **Consistency:** Does the schema data match the visible text exactly?
