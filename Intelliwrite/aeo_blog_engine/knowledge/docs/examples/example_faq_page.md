# AEO & GEO — Frequently Asked Questions

## Topic: Everything you need to know about AEO

### What is AEO?
AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing content to provide direct, concise answers that can be easily extracted by search engines (for featured snippets) and AI assistants (like Siri, Alexa, or Chatbots).

### How is AEO different from traditional SEO?
While traditional SEO focuses on ranking a URL for a list of keywords to drive clicks, AEO focuses on providing a single, precise answer to a specific question to drive immediate value, often without a click (zero-click searches).

### What benefits does AEO bring?
AEO increases brand visibility in "position zero" (featured snippets), improves performance in voice search, and prepares your content for the era of AI-generated answers, establishing your brand as a trusted authority.

### How to implement AEO?
Implement AEO by structuring content with question-based headings (H2/H3), providing immediate 20-50 word answers under those headings, using lists and tables for data, and applying Schema markup (FAQPage, HowTo).

### How long does AEO take to show results?
AEO results can be faster than traditional SEO if you target low-competition long-tail questions, but generally, it follows similar timelines to SEO, taking 3-6 months to build significant authority and capture snippet positions.

### Are there any downsides of AEO?
The main potential downside is "zero-click" traffic, where users get their answer without visiting your site. However, the brand awareness and authority generated often outweigh the loss of superficial traffic.

### When should I update AEO content?
Update AEO content whenever the factual answer to the question changes, or at least every 6-12 months to ensure accuracy, as freshness is a key signal for answer engines.
