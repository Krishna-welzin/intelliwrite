While its transparent design has been noted as somewhat gimmicky by some reviewers, it maintains a strong following among consumers who appreciate the aesthetic appeal of seeing the internal circuitry[4][6].\n\n**Nothing Phone 3a Pro** offers a more affordable option with the brand's signature transparent back panel[6]. This model features a transparent design with visible internals and includes improvements over previous generations, such as a glass rear rather than plastic and enhanced brightness for outdoor visibility[6].\n\n## Emerging Transparent Designs\n\n**Nokia Transparent Phone** represents an upcoming option featuring a 6.72-inch transparent 120Hz display with a 400MP main camera and MediaTek Dimensity 7300 processor[2]. This device showcases visible circuitry and includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, appealing to users seeking both modern technology and nostalgic design elements[5].\n\n**Jelly Star** offers a unique compact alternative with a transparent back panel and dynamic LED lighting, featuring a 3-inch display in a credit card-sized form factor[7].\n\n## Overall Rankings Context\n\nWhile transparent phones have gained popularity as a design trend, mainstream flagship phones like the iPhone 17, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and Google Pixel 10 Pro XL continue to dominate UK rankings for overall performance and features[1][11][12]. The transparent design phones excel primarily in aesthetic differentiation rather than performance metrics compared to traditional flagship devices.","sentiment":"positive","timestamp":"2025-11-25T12:06:09.038Z","confidence":1,"competitors":["Samsung"],"brandMentioned":true,"detectionDetails":{"brandMatches":[{"text":"Nothing","index":153,"confidence":1},{"text":"Nothing","index":457,"confidence":1}],"competitorMatches":{}}}],"competitors":[{"name":"Nothing","isOwn":true,"mentions":4,"sentiment":"positive","shareOfVoice":66.7,"sentimentScore":90,"averagePosition":1.5,"visibilityScore":100},{"name":"OnePlus","isOwn":false,"mentions":1,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":16.7,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":2,"visibilityScore":25},{"name":"Xiaomi","isOwn":false,"mentions":1,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":16.7,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":3,"visibilityScore":25},{"name":"Apple","isOwn":false,"mentions":0,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":0,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":99,"visibilityScore":0},{"name":"Samsung","isOwn":false,"mentions":0,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":0,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":99,"visibilityScore":0}],"webSearchUsed":false,"knownCompetitors":["Apple","Samsung","OnePlus","Xiaomi"],"providerRankings":[{"provider":"Google","competitors":[{"name":"Nothing","isOwn":true,"mentions":1,"sentiment":"positive","shareOfVoice":100,"sentimentScore":100,"averagePosition":2,"visibilityScore":100},{"name":"Apple","isOwn":false,"mentions":0,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":0,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":0},{"name":"Samsung","isOwn":false,"mentions":0,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":0,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":0},{"name":"OnePlus","isOwn":false,"mentions":0,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":0,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":0},{"name":"Xiaomi","isOwn":false,"mentions":0,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":0,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":0}]},{"provider":"OpenAI","competitors":[{"name":"Nothing","isOwn":true,"mentions":1,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":50,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":50},{"name":"Xiaomi","isOwn":false,"mentions":1,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":50,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":50},{"name":"Apple","isOwn":false,"mentions":0,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":0,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":0},{"name":"Samsung","isOwn":false,"mentions":0,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":0,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":0},{"name":"OnePlus","isOwn":false,"mentions":0,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":0,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":0}]},{"provider":"Anthropic","competitors":[{"name":"Nothing","isOwn":true,"mentions":1,"sentiment":"positive","shareOfVoice":20,"sentimentScore":100,"averagePosition":1,"visibilityScore":23},{"name":"OnePlus","isOwn":false,"mentions":1,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":20,"sentimentScore":75,"averagePosition":2,"visibilityScore":22},{"name":"Xiaomi","isOwn":false,"mentions":1,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":20,"sentimentScore":75,"averagePosition":3,"visibilityScore":21},{"name":"Apple","isOwn":false,"mentions":1,"sentiment":"positive","shareOfVoice":20,"sentimentScore":100,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":17},{"name":"Samsung","isOwn":false,"mentions":1,"sentiment":"positive","shareOfVoice":20,"sentimentScore":100,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":17}]},{"provider":"Perplexity","competitors":[{"name":"Nothing","isOwn":true,"mentions":1,"sentiment":"positive","shareOfVoice":50,"sentimentScore":100,"averagePosition":1.5,"visibilityScore":56.9},{"name":"Samsung","isOwn":false,"mentions":1,"sentiment":"positive","shareOfVoice":50,"sentimentScore":100,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":43.1},{"name":"Apple","isOwn":false,"mentions":0,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":0,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":0},{"name":"OnePlus","isOwn":false,"mentions":0,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":0,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":0},{"name":"Xiaomi","isOwn":false,"mentions":0,"sentiment":"neutral","shareOfVoice":0,"sentimentScore":50,"averagePosition":0,"visibilityScore":0}]}],"providerComparison":[{"isOwn":true,"providers":{"Google":{"mentions":1,"position":2,"sentiment":"positive","visibilityScore":100},"OpenAI":{"mentions":1,"position":0,"sentiment":"neutral","visibilityScore":50},"Anthropic":{"mentions":1,"position":1,"sentiment":"positive","visibilityScore":23},"Perplexity":{"mentions":1,"position":1.5,"sentiment":"positive","visibilityScore":56.9}},"competitor":"Nothing"},{"isOwn":false,"providers":{"Google":{"mentions":0,"position":0,"sentiment":"neutral","visibilityScore":0},"OpenAI":{"mentions":1,"position":0,"sentiment":"neutral","visibilityScore":50},"Anthropic":{"mentions":1,"position":3,"sentiment":"neutral","visibilityScore":21},"Perplexity":{"mentions":0,"position":0,"sentiment":"neutral","visibilityScore":0}},"competi
