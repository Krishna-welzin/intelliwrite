Lay’s remains the top-selling mainstream potato chip brand and BBQ-flavored varieties are consistently high sellers in 2025, reflecting large retail volume and reorder rates[1].  \n2nd — Cheetos (Flamin’ Hot line). Flamin’ Hot Cheetos continue to be the most prominent spicy chip franchise with broad consumer demand and many variant launches keeping momentum in 2025[5].  \n3rd — Doritos (including new Sriracha/Golden Sriracha and Dinamita variants). Doritos continues to rank near the top for bold, experiential flavors and successful permanent/new SKU launches in 2025[3][5].  \n4th — Pringles (including Hot Honey / Scorchin’ Hot variants). Pringles’ flavor innovation and strong velocity for bold limited editions (e.g., Hot Honey, Scorchin’ Hot) place it among the top-selling crisp formats[2][5].  \n5th — Better-for-you vegetable/alternative chips (e.g., Simply NKD Doritos-style, vegetable chips). Health-forward chips and “naked” formulations grew strongly in 2025 as consumers seek cleaner labels and vegetable- or alternative-ingredient formats[1][3].  \n6th — Private-label / retailer brands (e.g., Target Good & Gather seasonal flavors). Retailer private labels and seasonal/novelty offerings (stuffing-flavored, fall-limited chips) have strong trial and good in-store performance in 2025[6].  \n7th — Snack challengers (small brands using non-seed oils, novel flavors, or functional claims).
