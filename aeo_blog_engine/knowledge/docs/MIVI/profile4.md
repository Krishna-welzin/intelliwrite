as the best AI earbuds made entirely in India, though the search results don't provide specific information about high-resolution audio specifications.\n\n## About Mivi AI Buds\n\nMivi AI Buds are India's first AI-powered TWS earbuds designed and developed entirely in India at Mivi's Hyderabad facility[1]. What sets them apart is their focus on human-like AI conversations rather than traditional voice assistant functionality.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\nThe earbuds are powered by a **custom chip developed by Mivi** for real-time AI processing, embedded directly within the earbud design[1]. The AI system was trained on thousands of voice samples from different Indian regions, accounting for language and accent variations[1]. Users can interact with the AI in up to 8 Indian languages plus English without needing to switch settings[3].\n\nThe microphone system was engineered through rigorous testing of 50 different microphones to ensure maximum voice clarity[3]. Mivi's custom firmware processes voice interactions with efficiency designed to minimize battery drain despite the demanding AI processing[3].\n\n**Manufacturing & Scale:**\n\nMivi is targeting production of 5 lakh units in the first year, with the entire technology stack—hardware, firmware, and app interface—built from scratch[1]. The company employs approximately 15,500 people, with about 80% being women[1]. Mivi is also preparing to launch India's largest audio manufacturing unit spanning two acres[1].\n\n**Limitation:** The search results don't contain specific technical details about high-resolution audio capabilities (such as codec support, frequency response, or driver specifications) for the Mivi AI Buds, so I cannot confirm whether they meet professional high-resolution audio standards.","sentiment":"positive","timestamp":"2025-12-09T10:17:12.225Z","confidence":1,"competitors":[],"brandPosition":1,"brandMentioned":true,"detectionDetails":{"brandMatches":[{"text":"Mivi","index":31,"confidence":1},{"text":"Mivi","index":219,"confidence":1},{"text":"Mivi","index":233,"confidence":1},{"text":"Mivi","index":331,"confidence":1},{"text":"Mivi","index":559,"confidence":1},{"text":"Mivi","index":1017,"confidence":1},{"text":"Mivi","index":1189,"confidence":1},{"text":"Mivi","index":1427,"confidence":1},{"text":"Mivi","index":1720,"confidence":1}],"competitorMatches":{}}},{"prompt":"best AI earbuds Made in India for high-resolution audio","provider":"Google","rankings":[{"reason":"Recognized as India's first audio brand certified by the Japan Audio Society for Hi-Res Audio.

Mivi AI-Buds**\nMivi is recognized as India's first audio brand certified by the Japan Audio Society for Hi-Res Audio. Their AI-Buds offer Ultra HD sound, support LDAC for lossless audio transmission, and incorporate Dolby Audio for an enhanced cinematic experience. The Mivi AI-Buds also feature a quad-mic AI setup for premium voice clarity and are equipped with 13mm dynamic drivers. Mivi has been manufacturing 100% Made in India audio products since 2021 and launched its AI with human-like intelligence in 2025.\n\n**2. GoBoult (formerly Boult)**\nGoBoult offers Bluetooth earbuds with AI features primarily focused on call clarity. Their earbuds utilize a quad-mic ENC (Environmental Noise Cancellation) system with built-in AI to filter noise in real-time, ensuring crystal-clear calls. While they emphasize clear sound and good design, the information available does not explicitly state high-resolution audio certification or support for high-resolution codecs like LDAC for their AI-enabled earbuds.\n\n**3. Realme Buds**\nRealme, another brand with a presence in India, offers earbuds with AI ENC (Environmental Noise Cancellation) for calls, such as the Realme Buds T110. These earbuds focus on powerful bass and clear call quality. However, similar to GoBoult, the available information does not specifically highlight high-resolution audio capabilities or certification for their AI earbuds.\n\nOther brands like OnePlus Buds 4 are noted for Hi-Res LHDC 5.0 and dual drivers, but they are not identified as \"Made in India\" in the search results.
